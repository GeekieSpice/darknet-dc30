QUEST: CREEPER GONNA GET YOU

+-+-+

Just as with nature, computers have their own forms of evolution. In 1971, Bob Thomas wrote the first experimental self-replicating program at BBN Technologies. This virus, named Creeper after the message it prints was designed to infect DEC PDP-10 and spread over the ARPANET. Since then, Computer Viruses have developed their own taxonomy, although the strict definitions aren't always used.

What is the exact message given by the Creeper virus?
