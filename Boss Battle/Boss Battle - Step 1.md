QUEST: BOSS BATTLE STEP 1

+-+-+

Agents,

Earlier this week, we started detecting packets from a suspicious source coming into our various networks around the globe. Those packets come in bursts, from many different sources at the same time, and we need your help to analyze them.

Judging by the timing of those transmissions, the next one should start arriving at 10am PST, Aug 14. We invite you all to the contest area to investigate the transmission together and hopefully understand its meaning.

Be on time.

More info will be posted to the [Darknet-NG Discord](https://https//discord.gg/uNCvJSWD) Announcements Channel and [Darknet-NG Twitter](https://twitter.com/DarknetNG)
