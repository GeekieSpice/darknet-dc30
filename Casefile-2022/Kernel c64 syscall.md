QUEST: KERNEL C64 SYSCALL

+-+-+

Kernel grew up on the Commodore 64. And still loves writing really strange programs for it.

Download the Commodore Emulator here:Â [C64 emulator](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vice-emu/)

In /bin, run the x64sc Commodore 64 emulator.

Last year you all complained about actually having to physically type in a program. So I put it on a diskimage this year.

Attach the "kerneldrive.d64" file to your emulator.

Load and execute the SYSCALL file.

What message did it return?
