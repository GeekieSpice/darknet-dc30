# Mad Hatter's Lair

This is weird... only one door, but its got a blackout curtain covering on one wall...but we are no where near any windows.

The blackout curtain covers two holes in the wall that are spaced apart for someones eyes.

You look thorught and see two teal chairs. That room looks familiar....

There is a code next to the eye cut outs: [[1.0 - MHLHUY365869]]
