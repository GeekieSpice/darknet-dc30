You have received a cryptic note about a tea party and some lair with a bunch of hats or something. It mentions you should go to [https://cyoca.tits-holon.network/Mad_Hatters_Lair/](https://cyoca.tits-holon.network/Mad_Hatters_Lair/).

You will know the first flag when you see it.

# Mad Hatter's Lair

Hey! Glad you could meet me here to help me explore the Mad Hatters Lair! I'm glad you didn't get lost down the [rabbit hole](https://cyoca.tits-holon.network/Rabbit_Hole/) back there..It looks like we have more encryptions to decode in order to find the heart of the lair.

Oh look, a crumpled up note was thrown in the corner over there....

"It looks like we had an infiltration issue about a year ago. It does not look like whoever it was got very far BUT as a precaution, we have changed the access codes to the lair. REMEMBER! All access codes will be in this format:

MHLXXXXXXXX

As a precaution please destroy this note.

-Decker 5"

Well, it seems they did not follow directions and we have a hint for the formatting for the access codes for the doors in this place. Lets get cracking!

...you see a single door with an access pannel and the following cipher:

TUhMRE9QRVROSFQ=

Decode base64 to the next room: [[01 - MHLDOPETNHT - 3 Doors]]
