# Mad Hatter's Lair

Theres two teal chairs in surprisingly good condition and a weird portrait on the opposite wall; the eyes look like they are following you. Creepy. I feel like I've been here before...have I?

There's another door but there is no way to unlock the mechanism from this side, and it looks to be going back in the wrong direction.
