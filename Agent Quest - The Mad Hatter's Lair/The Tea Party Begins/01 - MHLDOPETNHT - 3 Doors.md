# Mad Hatter's Lair

Oh hey, multiple doors...what is this,a maze or some dungeon with a lot of locked doors? Ugh..

Across from the room there are three doors with access pannels and some numbers above them:

Door 1: 13-8-12-21-20-2-8-10-8-14-11 = [[1.1 - MHLUTBHJHNK - Mirror]] 

Door 2: 13-8-12-12-15-25-5-4-21-15-16 = [[1.2 - MHLLOYEDUOP - 2 Doors]] - tiny note

Door 3: 13-8-12-1-2-7-20-11-13-11-12 = [[1.3 - MHLABGTKMKL - Bash at]] - french bird
