# Mad Hatter's Lair

Oh hey, a dead end...it looks like it is storage for a ....tea party?

Cups, saucers, spoons, tea pots, tables and chairs...ooo, a really big mirror. Fancy...

A note on the wall -

"If you take any items for a tea party, the item must be logged and checked out. ALL ITEMS MUST BE BROUGHT BACK WITHIN 3 DAYS OF THE END OF THE PARTY. ALL ITEMS MUST BE CLEANED. If an item is brough back without being cleaned you will need to face the Queen of Hearts."
