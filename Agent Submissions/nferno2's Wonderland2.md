QUEST: NFERNO2'S WONDERLAND2

+-+-+

Great job making it this far, you've correctly identified that the signal is an Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) signal. ADS-B is the newest generation of flight tracking for air traffic control and has begun to supplant secondary radar surveillance for flight tracking ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Dependent_Surveillance%E2%80%93Broadcast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Dependent_Surveillance%E2%80%93Broadcast)). This is significant because ADS-B provides significantly more information to the controller than legacy Mode C which only provides a 4-digit identification code, location based on radar coverage, and altitude.

Lets begin with an easy question: What is the secondary ADS-B frequency (in MHz) that has been exclusively deployed in the U.S. to reduce congestion on the primary international frequency?
